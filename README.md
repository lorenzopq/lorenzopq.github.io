       <p>I like <a href="https://www.minecraft.net ">Minecraft</a> so much because of its replayability. I can play it for hours and hours and no get bored. I also like Minecraft because I've been playing since kindergaten amd since then they have updated the game in ways that unlike other games, does not ruin the game.</p>

        <p>I started to play <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com">Escape From Tarkov<a> at the beginning of summer. I instantly liked it for its realism, brutality, and unforgiving nature. Just because it is a highly competitve game does not mean i don't have fun in it. I like to mess around with my friends and cause chaos.</p>

        <p>I first played <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com › en-us › game › siege">Rainbow Six</a> at the end of fourth grade. It got me into other realistis First Person Shooters but none of them were better (until Escape From Tarkov)than Rainbow. I loved playing it it was a great game but over the years and updates the community and game got worse. I gradually stopped playing the game and i have not played it in a long while. It still has a place in my heart for being the game to get me into other games. </p>
